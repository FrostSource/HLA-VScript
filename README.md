# Half Life Alyx VScript API
Definitions for Half Life Alyx scripting to be used with [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server).

Many functions still have unknown uses or are broken in Half Life Alyx but are still present at runtime, so they are still defined by this addon even if not properly documented.

This addon was created in conjunction with [AlyxLib](https://github.com/FrostSource/alyxlib).
